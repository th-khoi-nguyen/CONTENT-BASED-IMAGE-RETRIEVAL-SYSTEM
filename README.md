This project is trying to create a content-based image retrieval system which is based on the idea of "Bag of Visual Words". The image's similar patterns are detected using SIFT (scale-invariant feature transform). Then K-means clustering is implemented to create the "visual" dictionary's vocabularies.

The images I used in this project are collected from many resources from the Internet. The images are not uploaded here. However, you can still apply this model to any dataset you have.
